    abstract = {In 2025, the bacterial diversity database BacDive is the leading database for strain-level bacterial and archaeal information. It has been selected as an ELIXIR Core Data Resource as well as a Global Core Biodata Resource. Since its initial release more than ten years ago, BacDive (https://bacdive.dsmz.de) has grown tremendously in content and functionalities, and is a comprehensive resource covering the phenotypic diversity of prokaryotes with data on taxonomy, morphology, physiology, cultivation, and more. The current release (2023.2) contains 2.6 million data points on 97 334 strains, reflecting an increase by 52\% since the previous publication in 2021. This remarkable growth can largely be attributed to the integration of the world-wide largest collection of Analytical Profile Index (API) test results, which are now fully integrated into the database and searchable. A novel BacDive knowledge graph provides powerful search options through a SPARQL endpoint, including the possibility for federated searches across multiple data sources. The high-quality data provided by BacDive is increasingly being used for the training of artificial intelligence models and resulting genome-based predictions with high confidence are now used to fill content gaps in the database.},

    abstract = {The BRENDA enzyme database (https://www.brenda-enzymes.org), established in 1987, has evolved into the main collection of functional enzyme and metabolism data. In 2018, BRENDA was selected as an ELIXIR Core Data Resource. BRENDA provides reliable data, continuous curation and updates of classified enzymes, and the integration of newly discovered enzymes. The main part contains \&gt;5 million data for ∼90 000 enzymes from ∼13 000 organisms, manually extracted from ∼157 000 primary literature references, combined with information of text and data mining, data integration, and prediction algorithms. Supplements comprise disease-related data, protein sequences, 3D structures, genome annotations, ligand information, taxonomic, bibliographic, and kinetic data. BRENDA offers an easy access to enzyme information from quick to advanced searches, text- and structured-based queries for enzyme-ligand interactions, word maps, and visualization of enzyme data. The BRENDA Pathway Maps are completely revised and updated for an enhanced interactive and intuitive usability. The new design of the Enzyme Summary Page provides an improved access to each individual enzyme. A new protein structure 3D viewer was integrated. The prediction of the intracellular localization of eukaryotic enzymes has been implemented. The new EnzymeDetector combines BRENDA enzyme annotations with protein and genome databases for the detection of eukaryotic and prokaryotic enzymes.},

    abstract = {We present MediaDive (https://mediadive.dsmz.de), a comprehensive and expert-curated cultivation media database, which comprises recipes, instructions and molecular compositions of \&gt;3200 standardized cultivation media for \&gt;40 000 microbial strains from all domains of life. MediaDive is designed to enable broad range applications from every-day-use in research and diagnostic laboratories to knowledge-driven support of new media design and artificial intelligence-driven data mining. It offers a number of intuitive search functions and comparison tools, for example to identify media for related taxonomic groups and to integrate strain-specific modifications. Besides classical PDF archiving and printing, the state-of-the-art website allows paperless use of media recipes on mobile devices for convenient wet-lab use. In addition, data can be retrieved using a RESTful web service for large-scale data analyses. An internal editor interface ensures continuous extension and curation of media by cultivation experts from the Leibniz Institute DSMZ, which is interlinked with the growing microbial collections at DSMZ. External user engagement is covered by a dedicated media builder tool. The standardized and programmatically accessible data will foster new approaches for the design of cultivation media to target the vast majority of uncultured microorganisms.},
